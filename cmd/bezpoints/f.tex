 for $t$ between 0 and 1, where $p0$ is the start point, $p1$ is control point, $p2$ is end point, and $c$ are the computed coordinates.
 $$
 c_x = (1-t)^2 \times p0_x + 2(1-t) \times t \times p1_x + t^2 \times p2_x
 $$

 $$
 c_y = (1-t)^2 \times p0_y + 2(1-t) \times t \times p1_y + t^2 \times p2_y
